Mineral fortifiers are commonly incorporated into processed foods such as cereals, snacks, dairy products, and ready-to-eat meals. These fortifiers are essential in addressing nutrient deficiencies, especially in populations that may not have access to a balanced and varied diet. As consumers become more health-conscious, food manufacturers are leveraging mineral fortifiers to enhance the nutritional profile of their products, thus boosting the overall appeal and marketability. Additionally, the growing popularity of clean-label products, which emphasize minimal ingredients and health benefits, has accelerated the demand for natural mineral fortifiers that align with consumer preferences for transparent and healthy food choices.The beverage sector has also witnessed substantial growth in the incorporation of mineral fortifiers. Functional beverages, such as energy drinks, sports drinks, fortified water, and even juices, are increasingly fortified with essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium. This surge in mineral fortification within the beverage industry can be attributed to the rising consumer inclination toward drinks that offer hydration along with health benefits.
